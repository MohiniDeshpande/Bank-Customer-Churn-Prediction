# Bank-Customer-Churn-Prediction
This project implements various machine learning algorithms to predict customer churn in a banking dataset. By analyzing customer data, the model identifies patterns that indicate whether a customer is likely to leave the bank. This is crucial for banks to develop retention strategies and improve customer satisfaction.
